# PostsAPI Example

This example was made using CRA & React 16, Redux, Formik and React Router.

To run, start the API and then issue:

```
$ yarn install && yarn start
```

The application will start at port `3000`. You can change the port number through the `API_PORT` constant in the `actions` file.

To run the linter, use `yarn lint`
